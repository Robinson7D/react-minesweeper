## Minesweeper (in React)

I've read code in React repos previously, and thought it would be fun to build something super simple to get my hands dirty trying it out. Same goes for the Jest test-runner.

If things in here aren't exactly idiomatic, I apologize. Feel free to let me know - I'd love to learn more.
